Housing markets in London have witnessed a number of ups and downs, with volatile house prices in London tending to amplify changes in national house prices. London has\nexperienced several episodes of real house price deflation. From the patterns of previous cycles, it is hard to simply tell from the previous cycles' pattern that whether house prices are approaching a new peak or a downward adjustment.\n\nRecently as a result of the pandemic, increasing unemployment rate, wage cuts, business failures, and job uncertainty also brought huge impact to the house market in London. According to the Nationwide, house prices fell 1.7% in May from the previous month, the largest monthly fall for 11 years, due to the headwinds of Covid-19.\n\n#### Business Problem\nAs a matter of fact, it is of great necessity to integrate data science and machine learning technics with the study of London house market in order to assist clients making sensible and efficient choices.\nHow could we provide suggestions to our clients based on the study of neighborhoods for either settling or investing is our main business problem.
